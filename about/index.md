# About Me

I recently completed my PhD in physics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and am currently working as a freelance data scientist through the site [Upwork](www.Upwork.com). Prior to graduate school I attended St. John's University while also serving in the Minnesota National Guard, during which I was deployed twice- first to Kosovo and then to Iraq where I served as a team leader.
A copy of my resume can be found [here](/about/Capecchi_Resume.pdf).
