## About Me

I received my PhD in physics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017. I moved to a modeling team focused on the physics of fluid dynamics and worked a few years as a Sr. Simulation Engineer at Donaldson Inc. before transitioning back into academics, having found a great opportunity to work on the Lithium Tokamak Experiment- beta at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab (PPPL) as a postdoc and now Principal Investigator (PI) of this collaboration between PPPL and UW Madison. This research is in transition over to the ST-40 tokamak in the UK, and I am focusing on finding new opportunities to apply my blend of scientific research, analytical methods, and modeling skills, to government or industry positions.

### Research

**Current**: I am the Principal Investigator on a research collaboration between the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab. I manage a $1.5M DOE grant to research high energy ions sourced via a neutral beam injector on the Lithium Tokamak Experiment-beta device. I study the impact of these ions on the plasma, focusing on beam fueling of the plasma (an essential goal for a device with lithium coated walls) as well as how their dynamics will impact plasma stability. To support this research, I develop and implement diagnostics which improves our ability to predict and model the plasma. A beam calorimeter, which leverages the differential heating of tungsten wire filaments, has been designed and installed on LTX-b and will measure the beam profile and will provide data on the injected beam power and energy. A Neutral Particle Analyzer, on loan from UW-Madison has also been retrofitted for use on LTX-b and will become the first direct measure of the high energy ion population within LTX-b.  
These diagnostics, and the neutral beam itself, require considerable amounts of data processing, analysis, and modeling. I use a combination of tools, varying from large models like [TRANSP](https://transp.pppl.gov/)  developed and maintained by PPPL, down to models I code and develop myself to handle specific dynamics needed to answer design or research questions. An example of the importance of this multi-model approach can be seen in [this paper](/about/prompt_loss_paper.pdf).

**Past**: My PhD research focused on identifying a pressure limit in the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST) reversed-field pinch (RFP) plasma device. More specifically, a certain type of magnetic instability called a "bursting" mode was identified and thought to be related the population of high energy ions ("fast-ions") injected via the neutral beam. At a certain fast-ion pressure threshold (or normalized to the magnetic field a beta threshold) the ions would non-linearly interact with the background magnetic field driving a perturbation unstable resulting in the loss of a large portion of the fast-ion population.  
To measure this threshold I developed a collimated neutron detector, which by measuring the neutron emissivity across the plasma cross section allowed us to infer the fast-ion density and pressure profiles. This work involved extensive data modeling and analysis, but ultimately led to the first measurement of the fast-ion profile and bursting mode threshold, the first such measurement in an RFP.
