## About Me

I recently completed my PhD in physics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and am currently working as a freelance data scientist through the site [Upwork](www.Upwork.com). Prior to graduate school I attended St. John's University while also serving in the Minnesota National Guard, during which I was deployed twice- first to Kosovo and then to Iraq where I served as a team leader.

### Research

My PhD research focused on identifying a pressure limit in the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST) reversed-field pinch (RFP) plasma device. More specifically, a certain type of magnetic instability called a "bursting" mode was identified and thought to be related the population of high energy ions ("fast-ions") injected via the neutral beam. At a certain fast-ion pressure threshold (or normalized to the magnetic field a beta threshold) the ions would non-linearly interact with the background magnetic field driving a perturbation unstable resulting in the loss of a large portion of the fast-ion population.

To measure this threshold I developed a collimated neutron detector, which by measuring the neutron emissivity across the plasma cross section allowed us to infer the fast-ion density and pressure profiles. This work involved extensive data modeling and analysis, but ultimately led to the first measurement of the fast-ion profile and bursting mode threshold, the first such measurement in an RFP.
