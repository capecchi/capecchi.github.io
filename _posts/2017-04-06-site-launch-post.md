Getting my hands dirty today. Well let's not start things off with a lie- I built this
going through a tutorial yesterday then messed it all up trying to change themes, so
I'm rebuilding it today. Usually I find you learn a lot doing a tear-down/rebuild, and
there are certainly a lot of things for me to learn! Diving in!!
