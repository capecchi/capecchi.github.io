I'm excited to be launching this site today. I've been doing a lot of new and interesting work both on my own projects and for clients and I want to use this platform as a means to share some of those things I find particularly compelling.

To a lesser extent it might also serve as a repository for some random thoughts and adventures, but probably always told with an eye towards data.
