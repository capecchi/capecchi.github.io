This is the image of the tattoo design. It's an armband tattoo, so it wraps back on itself, the blue triangles mark the location of overlap and aren't part of the design. My forearm is something like 11-12" around at the location I'm planning, and this'll maybe be 1-1.5" tall.

Above is the line *shape* that I'd like, but I'd like to add some character to the tattoo by playing with the linestyle and possibly adding some other texture or shading. Open to ideas here. I'm not quite sure what I'm looking for, but below are some images with some aspects that catch my eye.
