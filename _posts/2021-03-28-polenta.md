Mom and Dad came out to visit us in NJ. They drove out, arriving Friday for dinner. We spent Saturday morning making polenta sauce. 

Brown pork by itself- when almost done, add onion (onion sweats a lot causing pork to boil instead of brown)
Careful cutting onions!
"making a hole"- once pork/onions are done, pull to outside of pan- add olive oil (1tsp) to middle and add garlic. stir until just starting to brown then mix to combine. cook another minute or so, then add to sauce

In pan where you did the pork, add 2Tbsp butter then half the mushrooms. cook down until water is gone and brown slightly then add to sauce. repeat with other half of mushrooms and another 2Tbsp butter.
