I haven't figured this one out- this is a post in progress!

## Okay, here's the deal.
I love trail running, and spend a *lot* of time in the woods at my local parks, running anywhere from just a few to 20+ miles depending on training. A lot of park maps, however, make it nearly impossible to determine an appropriate route before setting out. Consider for example, this fantastic park near Madison, WI.

**Unhelpful Distances**

Trying to piece together a 20 mile run is made very difficult by not having point-to-point mileage. While you can ballpark it, trail mileage tends to vary widely with terrain and a smooth dashed line on a map may not represent the actual mileage very closely.

I should be able to do a better job!
With a running watch, every trip to a park gives me data on its trails. If I can stitch these together, I should be able to generate my own park map. By detecting junctions, I can then break a park up into trail segments and generate a map with individual segments' mileage marked.
Getting the GPS data is the easy (and fun) part. Figuring out how to smooth the data and identify junctions turns out to be much more difficult (but still fun).

## Working with the data
To develop the code to handle processing park runs into a single map, I am working with these two runs.

**Two runs to use for code development**

Visually this task is simple. I could very easily identify junctions and the segments between them. But dealing with the actual arrays of GPS data, how do you know where the junctions are?
